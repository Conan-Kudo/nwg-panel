# Contributing

The program is still in quite early development, and likely to have many unknown bugs. Please keep
in mind that fixing them has the highest priority, over new features and modules.

## Issues

Opening issues is the preferred way to report bugs. However, new ideas may also be submitted this way.

## Pull requests

Bug fixes are more than welcome. In case you'd like to add a new feature, consider opening an issue first, 
to discuss planned changes / additions.

Feel free to share your executors in the [executors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel/tree/master/nwg_panel/executors)
folder.

## Contact

In case you'd rather not to open an issue, I'm active on the ArchLabs Linux forum, and opened 
the [nwg-panel thread](https://forum.archlabslinux.com/t/nwg-panel/5289) there.

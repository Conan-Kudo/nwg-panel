This application is a part of the [nwg-shell](https://nwg-piotr.github.io/nwg-shell) project.

***Nwg-panel** is a GTK3-based panel for [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) 
Wayland compositors. The panel is equipped with a graphical configuration program that frees the user from the need to 
manually edit configuration files.

Currently, we have a dozen of modules, and I don't plan on many more:

- Controls module: 

Basis system controls are available in the Controls module, and whatever else you may need, 
[there's an executor for that](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel/wiki/Some-useful-executors).

See [Wiki](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel/wiki) for more information. You'll also find some useful
executor examples there.

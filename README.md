This application is a part of the [nwg-shell](https://nwg-piotr.github.io/nwg-shell) project.

***Nwg-panel** is a GTK3-based panel for [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) 
Wayland compositors. The panel is equipped with a graphical configuration program that frees the user from the need to 
manually edit configuration files.

Currently, we have a dozen of modules, and we don't plan on many more. Many minor tasks that users request a module for,
may be easily done with [executors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel/wiki/modules:-Executor).

- **Controls module**: basis system controls like brightness slider, volume slider (w/ per-app sliders), battery 
level w/ low level notification, system processes viewer, user-defined custom items, user-defined drop-down menu 
(which is the power menu by default)

executor examples there.

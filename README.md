I have been using sway since 2019 and find it the most comfortable working environment, but... 
Have you ever missed all the graphical bells and whistles in your panel, we used to have in tint2? It happens to me. 
That's why I decided to try to code a GTK-based panel, including best features from my two favourites: 
[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) and [tint2](https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2). Many thanks to Developers
and Contributors of the both projects!

There are 12 modules available at the moment, and I don't plan on many more. Basis system controls are available in the 
Controls module, and whatever else you may need, 
[there's an executor for that](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel/wiki/Some-useful-executors).
